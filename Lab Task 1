#Decision Tree 
A decision tree is to split the data into smaller subgroups until the target 
variable can be properly predicted. This research investigates the use of 
decision trees with the categorical and ordinal data included in the Titanic 
dataset. In order to tackle classification issues with both forms of data, the 
tasks entail creating and assessing decision tree models using the CART 
(Classification and Regression Tree) technique.

#CART 
The binary tree structure employed in this project, called CART, allows each 
internal node to have a maximum of two offspring.
